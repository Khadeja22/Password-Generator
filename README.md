# Password-Generator
This program generates different types of passwords based on the user's preferences of options such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, mixed letters, mixed letters and numbers, and mixed characters.
In this project, I utilized arrays, user input, exception handling, file handling, and control structures, all in several methods.

To use this program yourself, open the PasswordGenerator folder in the IDE of your choice. I used Visual Studio Code.
